     <p class="about me">
         Extremely motivated to constantly develop my skills and grow professionally. 
         I am confident in my ability to come up with intresting ideas and solutions.
    <br> When I was younger I was not able to speak English and it annoyed me so I decided to move to London,
         because i wanted to learn the language properly.
    <br> In the beginning I could not even say a word or pronounced them. 
         It took 1 year for me to speak english fluently, during a year I'd got promoted 5 times.
         Started from cleaning the kitchen to Restaurant Manager.
    <br> I reckon it shows that how motivated I have been
         and if you set your mind to do whatever you desire you can accomplish 
         anything.
   <br>  2 months ago I've started studying Web design and i have realized that i would like to do it in the future.
   <br>  Have you ever had that feeling when you do something and you really enjoy doing that?  
         You do not know how to stop, because all you want to do is keep learing new skills and gaining informations.
         Well this how i feel when i am studying Web Design.</p>
